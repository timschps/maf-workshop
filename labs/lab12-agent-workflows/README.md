# Lab 12: Agent Workflows — LLM-Powered Pipelines

[📋 Back to Lab Guide](../../lab-guide.md)


**Duration:** 20 minutes
**Objective:** Build a workflow where real LLM agents collaborate as pipeline steps — Research → Write → Translate.

---

## What You'll Learn

- How to wrap `AIAgent` instances as workflow executors
- How agent output flows as typed messages between workflow steps
- How to build a practical content generation pipeline

---

## Conceptual Overview

```
  Sequential agent pipeline — each agent's output becomes the next one's input:

  ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
  │  Researcher  │────▶│  Writer      │────▶│  Editor      │
  │              │     │              │     │              │
  │  "Find 3-5  │     │  "Write a    │     │  "Polish,    │
  │   key facts │     │   short      │     │   fix grammar│
  │   about..." │     │   article"   │     │   add title" │
  │              │     │              │     │              │
  │  Output:     │     │  Output:     │     │  Output:     │
  │  Raw facts   │     │  Draft       │     │  Final       │
  │  & data      │──▶  │  article     │──▶  │  article     │
  └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘

  SequentialBuilder(participants: [researcher, writer, editor]).Build()
```

## Implementation

Choose your language:

- **[C# (.NET)](./csharp.md)**
- **[Python](./python.md)**

---

## 🏋️ Exercises

### Exercise A: Change the Target Language

Modify the `TranslatorExecutor` to accept a different target language. Try Spanish, Japanese, or Dutch.

### Exercise B: Add a Quality Check Step

Insert a `ReviewerExecutor` between Writer and Translator that evaluates quality and either passes through or requests a rewrite:

```
Research → Writer → Reviewer → Translator → Output
```

### Exercise C (Stretch): Parallel Research

Create two research agents that investigate different aspects of the topic in parallel, then have the writer synthesize both:

```
              ┌→ TechResearch ──────┐
Topic ───────→│                      │→ Writer → Translator → Output
              └→ EthicsResearch ─────┘
```

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Three-step pipeline runs successfully: Research → Write → Translate
- [ ] Each agent transforms the output and passes it to the next step
- [ ] Console logs clearly show data flowing through each executor
- [ ] You understand how `AgentWorkflowBuilder.BuildSequential` and `InProcessExecution.Default.RunAsync` work together
