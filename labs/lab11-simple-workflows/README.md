# Lab 11: Simple Workflows — Function Pipelines

[📋 Back to Lab Guide](../../lab-guide.md)


**Duration:** 15 minutes
**Objective:** Understand workflow basics by building function-based pipelines with executors and edges.

---

## What You'll Learn

- The difference between agents (open-ended) and workflows (explicit control)
- Workflow building blocks: Executors, Edges, WorkflowContext
- How to chain function executors and agent executors
- How data flows through a workflow graph

---

## Conceptual Overview

```
  Workflows give you explicit control over execution flow:

  ┌────────────┐      ┌────────────┐      ┌────────────┐
  │  Executor  │─────▶│  Executor  │─────▶│  Executor  │
  │  "Fetch"   │ edge │  "Process" │ edge │  "Format"  │
  │            │      │            │      │            │
  │  Function  │      │  Function  │      │  Function  │
  └────────────┘      └────────────┘      └────────────┘

  WorkflowBuilder
    .SetStart("fetch")
    .AddEdge("fetch" → "process")
    .AddEdge("process" → "format")
    .Build()

  vs. Agents (open-ended):        vs. Workflows (explicit):
  ┌──────────┐                    ┌──┐──▶┌──┐──▶┌──┐
  │  LLM     │  decides what      │A │   │B │   │C │
  │  decides │  to do next        └──┘   └──┘   └──┘
  └──────────┘                    You define the path
```

## Implementation

Choose your language:

- **[C# (.NET)](./csharp.md)**
- **[Python](./python.md)**

## 🏋️ Exercises

### Exercise A: Add a Third Step — Translator

Add a `TranslatorExecutor` that takes the English summary and translates it:

```
Topic → Research → Writer → Translator → Output
```

- Create a `TranslatorAgent` with instructions: `"Translate the following text to French."`
- Add a `TranslatorExecutor` that wraps this agent
- Add an edge from `writer` to `translator`
- Make the translator yield the final output

### Exercise B: Three-Step Pipeline with Validation

Add a validation step between Research and Writer:

```
Topic → Research → Validator → Writer → Output
```

The Validator checks if the research has at least 3 bullet points. If not, the workflow should request more research (you can simulate this with a conditional edge or by having the validator simply append "Please provide more detail" and loop back).

### Exercise C (Stretch): Parallel Fan-Out

Create a workflow where **two research agents** work in parallel on different aspects of a topic, then a writer combines both:

```
             ┌→ TechResearch ──┐
Topic ──────→│                  │→ Writer → Output
             └→ BusinessResearch┘
```

Hint: Look into `AddEdge` with multiple sources or `BuildConcurrent` patterns.

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Simple function workflow runs: UpperCase → Reverse
- [ ] Agent workflow runs: Research → Writer
- [ ] You can see data flowing between steps via the console logs
- [ ] You understand how `AgentWorkflowBuilder.BuildSequential` chains agents together
